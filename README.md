To run simply run the following command in the terminal: 

php dev-lib.php

then follow the prompts.

If you wish to provide credentials via a .env it MUST be in the following format

apikey:yourkey 

username:yourusername

Order of key value pairs doesnt matter.

if credential errors occur check spelling of keys in your env file
